These are several personalized Ansible playbooks and notes for my
Steam Deck. Feel free to use, read, or fork for your use case.

* Playbooks
** Desktop apps
- [[file:playbooks/desktop.yaml][Play]]
  
These are some apps that I install from flathub.
  
** Emulation
- [[file:playbooks/emulation.yaml][Play]] 
  
I mainly use [[https://retrodeck.net/][RetroDECK]] for emulation, but certain emulators don't
exist on it yet, so the [[https://www.emudeck.com/][EmuDECK]] installer is also there as backup.

** System setup
- [[file:playbooks/system.yaml][Play]] 

During the system setup, OpenSSH is brought up along with some basic
security configurations. Lastly, [[https://podman.io/][podman]] is installed in order for
[[https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox][distrobox]] to work.
