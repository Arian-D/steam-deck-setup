These are several personalized Ansible playbooks and notes for my
Steam Deck. Feel free to use, read, or fork for your use case.

** IN-PROGRESS [2/3] Emulation
- [[file:playbooks/emulation.yaml][Play]] 
I mainly use [[https://retrodeck.net/][RetroDECK]] for emulation, but certain emulators don't
exist on it yet, so the [[https://www.emudeck.com/][EmuDECK]] installer is also there as backup.
